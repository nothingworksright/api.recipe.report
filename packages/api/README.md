# ðŸ—ƒ Recipe.Report API Server  

![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2879801/154334825-d5c4873c-0f43-42a7-a5a8-74a1d38163d3.svg)  

This is the [source code repository](https://github.com/nothingworksright/recipe-report/tree/main/packages/api) for the Recipe.Report API Server.  

Written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)/[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)/[Inversify.js](https://inversify.io/)/[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), following the [Domain-Driven Design](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/domain-driven-design-intro/) approach.  

The API server is broken up into a multilayered architechture that implements a service/repository pattern. The API layer, the service layer, the business/domain layer, and the data access layer (repositories implemented through the unit-of-work pattern).  

Data is persisted using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), without an ORM. Connection to the database is made through the [pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) library, and all access to data happens via parameterized [stored functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xfunc.html). The database owner and the database app user are separate, with proper access levels.

## Env vars  

The following development environment variables with development values provide an example of the environment variables required in production. Environment variable values may be set in the `/etc/environment` file on a Linux host system:  

```bash
export NODE_ENV="development"
export RR_PORT="1138"
export RR_CRYPTO_KEY="MqSm0P5dMgFSZhEBKpCv4dVKgDrsgrmT"
export RR_CRYPTO_ALGO="aes-256-cbc"
export RR_CRYPTO_IV_LENGTH="16"
export RR_JWT_SECRET="devTestEnvironment"
export RRDB_USER="dbuser"
export RRDB_OWNER="dbowner"
export RRDB_HOST="localhost"
export RRDB_DATABASE="recipedb"
export RRDB_PASSWORD="dbpass"
export RRDB_PORT="15432"
export RRDB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:15432/recipedb"
export RRDB_MIGRATIONS="filesystem:./migrations"
export RR_LOG_TARGETS="trace.log+%json,stdout:warn%simple"
```

## Development  

Prepare the development database, install dependencies, and then launch the API server.  

### Database  

Prepare a development copy of the Recipe.Report database. From the data package directory (recipe-report/packages/data/), run the `vagrant up` command to create and configure a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro) VM running PostgreSQL. Once the development database is running, run the `npm run flyway` command to download [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/). Next, run the `npm run migrate` command to apply [database migrations](recipe-report/packages/data/migrations).  

```bash
cd ~/recipe-report/packages/data
vagrant up
npm run flyway
npm run migrate
```

### Install  

The Recipe.Report packages are organized into a monorepo. Install dependencies from the root directory (~/recipe-report/).  

```bash
cd ~/recipe-report
npm install
```

### API server  

Run the remaining commands from the api package directory (~/recipe-report/packages/api/).  

Run the `npm run prettier` command to format the source code using the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) opinionated styling. Run the `npm run linter` command to identify and report [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) code pattern findings. These can also be run automatically as IDE extensions.  

Run the `npm run updates` command to check for dependency updates.  

```bash
cd ~/recipe-report/packages/api
npm run prettier
npm run linter
npm run updates
```

When you're ready to see it in action, run the `npm run develop` command to start the Recipe.Report API Server in development mode. This will run both the `npm run build` command to [compile](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html#tsc-the-typescript-compiler) the TypeScript into plain JavaScript, and the `npm run start` command to run that compiled JavaScript.  

```bash
npm run develop
```

## API Endpoints  

### User  



Users can register, activate, and then access the application. Users are linked to accounts with roles.  

In the `rr.users_to_roles` table, a record links a user, a role, and an account.  

User passwords must pass minimum complexity according to [zxcvbn](https://dropbox.tech/security/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation).  

### Account  

Accounts have a primary user contact, in addition to users who are linked to accounts with roles.  

Most data, such as Recipes, belong to accounts.  

### Role  

Roles establish a level of access to an account.  

Example roles:  

Name|Description|Level
--|--|--
Kitchen Porter|Basic food preparation (newbie)|1
Commis Chef|Absorbing food knowledge (beginner)|2
Chef de Partie|Cooking the food (intermediate)|3
Sous Chef|In charge of the food (experienced)|4
Chef de Cuisine|Control all aspects of the food (expert)|5
Executive Chef|Manage the kitchen and staff (admin)|6

### Feature  

Features are accessible to users based on account roles. For example, all users with any role/level for an account can access the recipe list feature for that account. Other features might only be accessible by users with a role/level 3 and above for an account, or only by level 6, etc.  

## Production  

Instructions for setting up a production environment for the Recipe.Report API are outside of the scope of this readme document. Currently the production API instance runs [Debian Linux](https://www.debian.org/), uses [Uncomplicated Firewall](https://wiki.debian.org/Uncomplicated%20Firewall%20%28ufw%29), and uses [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy, and manages the Node.js process for the API using the PM2 process manager. DNS is pointed to Cloudflare and Nginx is configured to require [authenticated origin pulls](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/). Deployments happen through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
